lately i dont know what to think
i just want to scream my lungs out
now i realised that this is meaninless
now all i can feel is my doubt

my anxiety is getting the better of me
locked inside my room all day
cant muster up the strenght to get up
i just wish i wouldnt feel this way

anymore

and im so scared of death
yet i cant stay away
from the fact that i hope
i wont live to see another day

3am and i cant sleep
thinking about how ive lost control
but whats one more night alone
when you cant remember the touch of another soul?

so i guess ill write this shit
like anyone would ever care
just another dream
another dream to make me scared
